# 🔥Burn-after-Typing

Trust me! We all have bad or even evil thoughts😈 that pop up at some point, which sometimes not only startle us but also make us feel guilty and 
doubt ourselves on a moral level. We tend to forget that these are fleeting and incidental thoughts. Still, at the same time, the destructive emotions 
that make us come up with these thoughts must **be appropriately ventilated** and should not accumulate inside, which may gradually overwhelm our limited 
mental capacity😔. 

Accept yourself for having these moments! **Start by opening this website**: record the sudden bad thought in this safe and private space🔐. 
To type in is to let it go. The next time you log in to your account and see the last note, you may grin - how silly I was to think that! 

In this "burn after typing" process, which will probably happen many times, I hope you will grow more confident in your ability💪🏻 to control your emotions🤗.
